# Two sites on one server, and a backup restored into a new database (M7.3, ADR 0014).
#
# Called by the `sites` job of .github/workflows/ci.yml; run it locally the same way (see
# examples/sites/README.md). It proves, with the composed binary of examples/sales_extension:
#
#   1. two sites with different apps, reached by their Host, keep their users and DocTypes apart;
#   2. an unknown host is 404;
#   3. `site backup shop`, restored into the new empty database of `restore_check`, gives the same
#      documents (and the same login);
#   4. (M8.5) the approval workflow of `sales_order` and a shared saved view over HTTP: a Sales
#      User sends an order for approval, an Administrator saves the view "Pending approval" for
#      everyone, the Sales User sees it, filters with it, and cannot delete it;
#   5. (M9.4) the fixture of the sales app: the first `migrate` of a site kept the two customer
#      groups of the SQL migration and inserted the third, and a second `migrate` finds all three
#      unchanged;
#   6. (M9.5) a webhook on `sales_order` for the event `submit`, delivered by the worker to the
#      receiver of examples/sites/receiver.py (Python standard library, started and stopped by
#      this script): the delivery is signed, the receiver verifies the signature with the recipe
#      of docs/guide/webhooks.md and records it, exactly one `submit` delivery arrives for the
#      order that was approved, a forged signature is refused, and `webhook test` succeeds;
#   7. (M10.1) a site custom field, added to `customer` of the site `field` by
#      `customize field add` with the server running: it appears in that site's metadata within
#      15 s without a restart, not in `shop`'s, takes a value over the API, disappears with
#      `customize field disable` (the data is kept) and returns with it after `enable`;
#   8. (M10.3) user permissions: `user permission add` restricts the Sales User bob on `shop` to the
#      customer group Retail, so that the list shows the Retail and the no-group customers and not
#      the Wholesale one (404 by name), only one group is listed and `customer_group` offers no
#      create (also to a manager); `user permission list` shows the row and `remove` makes the
#      Wholesale customer visible again.
#

# that has CREATEDB, the PostgreSQL client tools (pg_dump, pg_restore) of the server's major
# version (FORGEBASE_PG_BIN names their directory when they are not first on PATH), curl, jq
# and python3 (the receiver). The three database URLs are read from the environment and never
# printed; the three databases must not exist yet (they are created, and left in place when the
# script ends: a local run drops them with DROP DATABASE).
