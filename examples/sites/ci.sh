# Two sites on one server, and a backup restored into a new database (M7.3, ADR 0014).
#
# Called by the `sites` job of .github/workflows/ci.yml; run it locally the same way (see
# examples/sites/README.md). It proves, with the composed binary of examples/sales_extension:
#
#   1. two sites with different apps, reached by their Host, keep their users and DocTypes apart;
#   2. an unknown host is 404;
#   3. `site backup shop`, restored into the new empty database of `restore_check`, gives the same
#      documents (and the same login);
#   4. (M8.5) the approval workflow of `sales_order` and a shared saved view over HTTP: a Sales
#      User sends an order for approval, an Administrator saves the view "Pending approval" for
#      everyone, the Sales User sees it, filters with it, and cannot delete it.
#
# Needs: the binary built (cargo build --locked -p sales_extension), PostgreSQL 16 with a role
# that has CREATEDB, the PostgreSQL client tools (pg_dump, pg_restore) of the server's major
# version (FORGEBASE_PG_BIN names their directory when they are not first on PATH),
# curl and jq. The three database URLs are read from the environment and never printed; the
# three databases must not exist yet (they are created, and left in place when the script ends:
# a local run drops them with DROP DATABASE).
#
#   SHOP_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/fb_sites_shop
#   FIELD_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/fb_sites_field
#   RESTORE_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/fb_sites_restore
#
# Optional: FORGEBASE_BIN (default target/debug/sales_extension), SITES_PORT (default 8000).
