-- The report "Sales by customer" (examples/sales/src/lib.rs declares its parameters and columns).
--
-- Positional parameters, in the order the report declares them: $1 from, $2 to (both required,
-- dates, inclusive), $3 customer (optional: NULL when absent, then every customer).
-- Columns, in order: customer, orders, total, last_order.
--
-- A Link field is stored as the id of the target row (a uuid), and the name of the document is
-- in the column `name`: the join turns the link into the customer's name, which is what a Link
-- column and a Link parameter carry.
--
-- Only submitted, not cancelled orders count (docstatus = 1). Row-level rules do not apply in a
-- report: the roles named in the report decide who may see this.
