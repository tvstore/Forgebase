## Context

Other systems want to know when a document changes: a new sales order should reach the warehouse system, a submitted invoice the accounting tool. Polling the API is wasteful and misses nothing only if the client is careful. Frappe offers webhooks with a template language and conditions; Forgebase wants the small, explicit version: **a site pushes a signed JSON snapshot to a URL after a document operation commits**.

Three things make this risky, and the decision is mostly about them:

- **Lost or phantom events.** An event sent before the commit describes a document that may never exist. An event sent after the commit by the request itself can be lost with the process. The outbox ([ADR 0013](0013-jobs-scheduler-and-transactional-outbox.md)) already solves both: the job is written in the transaction of the change.
- **SSRF.** A URL set by an operator is still a way to make the server open connections from inside the network: to a database, to an admin interface on localhost, to the cloud metadata service (`169.254.169.254`), or, through a DNS name that changes its answer, to anything. A guard that checks the name and then lets the HTTP library resolve it again is defeated by DNS rebinding.
- **Secrets.** The signing secret must be known to the sender in clear (HMAC needs the key), and URLs often carry a token in the path or the query. Neither may reach a log, an error message or a list.

## Decision

### The table

Webhooks are configured per site at runtime (owner decision 3), in the table `fb_webhook` of the site's database (migration 0010), so a webhook belongs to one site and a backup of the site includes it.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Primary key; the rules of a DocType name (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`). |
| `doctype` | The DocType it listens to: a DocType of the site's registry that is not a child DocType (checked by `webhook add`). |
| `events` | `text[]`, not empty, only `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `submit`, `cancel`, `transition` (also a `CHECK` constraint). |
| `url` | `https://` only, a host, no user info (checked by `webhook add` and again at every delivery). |
| `secret` | The signing secret, **stored in plain text** because the signature needs it. Anyone who can read the database can read it. |
| `enabled` | Default true. |
| `allow_private` | Default false. See the SSRF guard. |
| `insecure_http` | Default false. The explicit development flag that allows `http://`. Stored per webhook and shown by `list`. |
| `created_at`, `modified_at` | Timestamps. |

A partial index on `(doctype) WHERE enabled` serves the lookup below. The commands are `forgebase webhook add|list|disable|enable|remove|rotate-secret|test` (the [CLI guide](../guide/cli.md#webhook-commands-m92)). There is no desk screen and no HTTP route for webhooks: an operator configures them.

### The outbox, in `forgebase-db`

Every document operation of `forgebase-db` (`insert`, `update`, `delete`, `submit`, `cancel`, `amend`, `transition`) calls `webhooks::enqueue` **inside its own transaction, after the hooks and before the commit**: one indexed `SELECT` for the enabled webhooks of the DocType that listen to the event, and one `forgebase.deliver_webhook` job per match, inserted by the same function as every other job ([ADR 0013](0013-jobs-scheduler-and-transactional-outbox.md)), recorded as enqueued by the caller of the operation. The call is in the one place that every writer passes through: the HTTP API, the `doc` commands, the `Documents` handle of jobs and methods, and hooks that write. A rolled-back or failed operation enqueues nothing, by construction (a caller-owned transaction that is rolled back takes the jobs with it). Writes outside the document operations send no webhook: app SQL migrations and the workflow-state backfill of `migrate` are bookkeeping (the backfill does not change `version`), and a mass migration must not flood receivers.

| Operation | Events |
|---|---|
| `insert` | `insert` |
| `update` | `update` |
| `delete` | `delete` (the snapshot is the document as it was, with its rows) |
| `submit` | `submit` |
| `cancel` | `cancel` |
| `amend` | `insert` (of the new draft) |
| workflow transition | `transition`, and also `submit` or `cancel` when the transition moves the docstatus to 1 or 2 |

A webhook that listens to two events of one operation gets two deliveries, one per event, in the order above. The webhooks of one operation are enqueued in name order.

**Cost.** One indexed `SELECT` per write, on every site, with or without webhooks; with no match nothing else is done (the document is not even serialised). There is no cached "this site has no webhooks" flag: it would be state to keep consistent across processes (a `webhook add` in the CLI must reach a running server), for a query that costs a fraction of the write it follows.

**A binary without the job.** The job `forgebase.deliver_webhook` is registered by every binary (it is a built-in job, next to the clean-up jobs). A registry that lacks it, which only a hand-built one in a test can, fails the write with a clear `job:` error.

### The snapshot

The payload is **the document as stored after the operation** (before it, for a delete), with its child rows, `version`, `docstatus` and `workflow_state`, in the JSON of the document API: the code is `forgebase_db::json::document_to_json`, which `forgebase-http` uses for `GET /api/v1/resource/...`, so a receiver sees a familiar shape and there is one serialisation to maintain.

**The snapshot is not filtered by anybody's permissions.** A webhook is configured by an operator, who decides where the data goes; there is no "caller" to filter for, and a field that the user who made the change cannot read is still in the snapshot. This is the point of the feature and also its risk: see the [security model](../blueprint/security-model.md#outgoing-webhooks-m92-adr-0020).

A job payload is limited to 64 KiB. A snapshot that does not fit is replaced by `"data": null` and `"truncated": true` in the payload and the body: the write is never refused because of a webhook, and the receiver can fetch the document by its `name`.

### Delivery: the built-in job `forgebase.deliver_webhook`

It runs in the worker like every job (5 attempts, a delay of 30 s doubling up to 1 h, then `dead`; a 30 s job timeout around the client's own 10 s limit). The steps:

1. **Load the webhook by name.** Removed or disabled since the operation: the job **completes without sending** and the worker logs it (no secret).
2. **Body**, compact JSON: `{"event", "doctype", "name", "data", "occurred_at", "delivery"}` (and `"truncated": true` when it applies). `occurred_at` is the database time of the operation's transaction, RFC 3339 UTC. `delivery` is the id of the job.
3. **Headers.** `Content-Type: application/json`, `User-Agent: Forgebase-Webhook/<version>`, `X-Forgebase-Event`, `X-Forgebase-Delivery` (the job id: **the same on every retry**, so a receiver de-duplicates on it), `X-Forgebase-Timestamp` (Unix seconds at the time of this attempt) and `X-Forgebase-Signature`.
4. **Signature.** `sha256=` and the lower-case hex of `HMAC-SHA256(secret, "<timestamp>.<body>")` over the exact bytes of the body. Each attempt is signed afresh, with its own timestamp. The timestamp is in the signed text so that a captured delivery cannot be replayed later: a receiver that checks the timestamp against its clock (5 minutes is a good tolerance) and the signature rejects an old copy.
5. **Outcomes.**

   | Result | Job |
   |---|---|
   | 2xx | done |
   | 3xx | **permanent** failure: "redirects are not followed" |
   | other status, connection error, TLS error, timeout | retryable |
   | an address that is not allowed, an invalid URL | **permanent** |

6. **The response body is ignored:** at most 64 KiB are read and discarded, then the connection is dropped.
7. **Timeout:** 10 s for everything the delivery does (DNS, connection, TLS, the request, the response head and the discarded body).
8. **Logging and messages.** The messages (which become the job's `last_error` and the worker's log line) name only the scheme, the host and the port and the status: `http://host:port answered HTTP 500`. Never the URL's path or query, the secret or the signature.

At-least-once: a worker that dies after the request and before the job completes sends again, with the same delivery id.

**Verification recipe** (the receiver; the [webhooks guide](../guide/webhooks.md#verifying-a-delivery) has it in Python): take the raw body bytes (before parsing), the timestamp header and the signature header; reject if the timestamp is more than 5 minutes from now; compute `HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp + "." + body)`; compare with `hmac.compare_digest` (constant time); then de-duplicate on `X-Forgebase-Delivery`.

### The SSRF guard (owner decision 5): resolve, vet, pin

1. **URL.** `https`, or `http` only for a webhook with `insecure_http`; a host; no user info. Checked when the webhook is added, and again at every delivery (a row written around the CLI is checked too).
2. **Resolve ourselves.** `tokio::net::lookup_host`; an IP literal is used as it is.
3. **Check every address.** If **any** resolved address is blocked, the delivery is refused (permanent), unless the webhook has `allow_private`. The blocklist is one function with a unit test per range and its edges:

   | Family | Blocked |
   |---|---|
   | IPv4 | `0.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `100.64.0.0/10`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16` (link-local, with the cloud metadata address `169.254.169.254`), `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.0.0.0/24`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `198.18.0.0/15`, `224.0.0.0/4` (multicast), `240.0.0.0/4` (reserved, with `255.255.255.255`) |
   | IPv6 | `::/96` (this includes `::` and `::1` and the old IPv4-compatible form), `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`, `ff00::/8`; `::ffff:0:0/96` (IPv4-mapped) and `64:ff9b::/96` (NAT64) are checked as the IPv4 address they embed |

   Not listed, so allowed: documentation ranges (`192.0.2.0/24` and the like), 6to4 (`2002::/16`) and the other IPv6 transition prefixes. A public address that embeds a private one in a prefix that is not routed to the host cannot reach it from here.
4. **Pin.** The connector is given **only the vetted addresses**, through a resolver that returns them and never looks anything up; the name of the URL is used for the `Host` header and, with `https`, for the SNI and the certificate check. A DNS answer that changes between the check and the connection (DNS rebinding) therefore cannot redirect the request. The unit test connects to a host name that no resolver can answer, through the address it is given.
5. **No redirects.** The client does not follow them, and a 3xx is a permanent failure. A redirect is how an allowed host would send us to a blocked one.
6. **Any port is allowed.** A webhook to a port is the operator's decision; the address rules are what protects the network.
7. **`allow_private`** turns off step 3 only (an in-network receiver, a test). **`insecure_http`** turns off the `https` requirement only. Both are per webhook, off by default, set with an explicit flag at `add`, and shown by `list`. The security model names them as risks.

### TLS and the client (owner decision 6)

`hyper-util`'s legacy client (already in the tree through axum) with `hyper-rustls` 0.27 (`ring`, `http1`, `tls12`; **no** `aws-lc-rs`, `native-tokio` or `webpki-tokio`) and the operating system's trust store through `rustls-native-certs` (it honours `SSL_CERT_FILE`). The configuration is built by `forgebase_db::tls::native_client_config`, the code of ADR 0018 with the same roots, `ring` and TLS 1.2 and 1.3, so the connections to PostgreSQL and to webhook receivers share **one** TLS stack and one `rustls` version. HTTP/1.1 only; one request on a fresh connection (no pooling between deliveries). The new crates are three (`hyper-rustls`, `try-lock`, `want`); the [dependency evaluation](../blueprint/dependency-evaluation.md#14-outgoing-webhooks-m92) has the licences and the checks. The Dockerfile already provides the root store (ADR 0018).

Tests need to trust a test CA: `forgebase::testing::webhook_test_settings(ca_pem, timeout)` sets, once for the whole process, the roots the client trusts and its time limit (environment variables are not used: changing them in a running process is racy). It is part of the `testing` feature and changes nothing else.

### Secrets handling

- The secret is 32 random bytes from the operating system as 64 hex characters (the source of API token secrets), or the first line of standard input with `--secret-stdin`.
- `add` and `rotate-secret` print a generated secret **once**. A secret given on standard input is not printed back. `list` and every error never show it; `Webhook`'s `Debug` omits it and the URL.
- It is stored in clear in `fb_webhook`: HMAC needs the key. A backup of the site contains it (like the password hashes it already contains, see the [CLI guide](../guide/cli.md)), so a backup is as sensitive as the database.
- **`rotate-secret`** replaces it; the receiver must switch at the same time, or accept both for a while.

### Non-goals

A webhook screen in the desk; payload templates or conditions in the configuration; inbound webhook receivers (an app method and an API token do that, [ADR 0019](0019-app-method-endpoints.md)); sync between sites; a delivery log table (the job queue is the log: `forgebase job list`, and a dead delivery stays until the purge job removes it after 7 days); per-webhook retry settings (the job's defaults apply).

## Alternatives considered

- **`reqwest`.** Rejected: version 0.13 defaults to rustls with `aws-lc-rs`, a C library that needs CMake; the other rustls feature set still pulls `webpki-roots` (CDLA-Permissive-2.0, avoided in ADR 0018). More dependencies for a client that needs one POST.
- **`ureq`.** Rejected: version 3 adds about 46 crates for a blocking client, which would also have to run on a blocking thread.
- **Sending inline, in the request.** Rejected: the request would wait for a third party (and fail or time out because of it), an event could be sent for a transaction that then rolls back (the very bug the outbox exists to prevent), and a crash after the commit would lose it.
- **A hook that enqueues.** Rejected: hooks are app code, per app; the framework's guarantee must not depend on every app remembering. The enqueue is in `forgebase-db`, below the hooks.
- **Checking the name, then letting the connector resolve it.** Rejected: DNS rebinding. Resolving and pinning is a few dozen lines.
- **Filtering the snapshot by the caller's permissions.** Rejected: there is no caller (the receiver is an operator's system), and a filtered snapshot would differ by who happened to make the change.
- **A flag "this site has webhooks" to skip the query.** Rejected, see Cost.
- **Encrypting the secret in the database.** Not done: the key would have to live somewhere the process can read, which is the same place an attacker with the database already is in most deployments; the honest statement is "plain text, protect the database".
- **Delivery in order.** Not promised: deliveries are independent jobs, retries reorder them. The snapshot carries `version`, so a receiver can ignore an older one.

## Consequences

- **A site with webhooks needs a running worker** (`forgebase worker`); without one the deliveries wait in the queue, which is the same as any job.
- **The public API grows** by `forgebase::testing::webhook_test_settings` only ([ADR 0012](0012-app-model-and-public-api-boundary.md#public-surface-update-m92)). `forgebase-db` gains the public modules `webhooks`, `json` and `tls` (an internal crate, no promise).
- **A new `DbError::Webhook`** for the webhook commands, answered as an internal error by the HTTP API (it never comes from a document operation).
- **The `forgebase` crate depends on `axum` and `tower` unconditionally** now (they were optional, for the `testing` feature): the webhook client builds its requests with `axum::http` and uses `tower::Service` for the pinned resolver, both of which `forgebase-http` already compiles in. No new crate.
- **The worker count of built-in jobs is 4** (the three clean-ups and the delivery); `forgebase.deliver_webhook` has no schedule.
- **Limits:** one request per delivery on a new connection; no keep-alive; the response is never inspected beyond its status; a receiver that needs ordering must use `version`.
- **Not covered:** client certificates (mTLS) to receivers, a proxy for outgoing requests (`HTTPS_PROXY` is not read), a per-webhook timeout, IPv6 transition prefixes beyond the two listed.
