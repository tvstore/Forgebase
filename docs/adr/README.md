# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records one significant decision: the context, what was decided, what else was considered, and the consequences. ADRs are immutable once **Accepted**: to change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one. Process rules: [maintenance-policy](../blueprint/maintenance-policy.md#documentation-and-adr-rules). Design overview: [architecture](../blueprint/architecture.md).
