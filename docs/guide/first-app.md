# Your first Forgebase app

This guide takes you from nothing to an app with tests that runs, extends another app and upgrades safely. Every command here was run against the repository at the time of writing. Background and decisions: [ADR 0012](../adr/0012-app-model-and-public-api-boundary.md) and [the architecture](../blueprint/architecture.md#the-app-model-m51-accepted-by-adr-0012).

An app is a Rust crate with three kinds of content: **DocTypes** (TOML files that describe your data and who may use it), **hooks** (Rust code that runs at fixed points of a document operation) and **migrations** (SQL that changes data once per database). Apps are compiled into one binary that you build and run. There are no plugins and no runtime discovery: everything is listed explicitly in `src/lib.rs` and `src/main.rs`.

## What you need

- A Forgebase checkout (the repository is private; apps use it by path, see [the dependency](#the-forgebase-dependency)) and the Rust toolchain it needs (`rust-version` in its `Cargo.toml`).
- A PostgreSQL 16 server. The tests need a superuser (or `CREATEDB`) URL; running the app needs an empty database.

## 1. Create the app

Build the stock binary once, then generate:

```sh
cargo build -p forgebase                      # in the Forgebase checkout
target/debug/forgebase new-app crm --forgebase-path . --dir ~/apps
```

The name is the app name and the crate name: lowercase letters, digits and underscores, starting with a letter, at most 54 bytes (it is also the prefix of your DocTypes). The command refuses an existing directory, never overwrites, and needs no database. It creates `~/apps/crm`:

```
crm/
  Cargo.toml              package, forgebase path dependency, its own [workspace]
  Cargo.lock              copied from the Forgebase checkout
  src/lib.rs              pub fn app() -> forgebase::App
  src/main.rs             Forgebase::new().app(crm::app()).run()
  doctypes/crm_note.toml  one sample DocType, with permissions for the role "Crm User"
  migrations/README.md    how to add SQL data migrations
  tests/app.rs            guard test, startup check, a hook test, an end-to-end test
  README.md  AGENTS.md  .gitignore
```

`AGENTS.md` is for the people and agents who will maintain the app: where things live, and the rules (depend on `forgebase` only, list every DocType, additive DocType changes, append-only migrations, pure hooks). Keep it up to date.

## 2. Test and run it

```sh
cd ~/apps/crm
export FORGEBASE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/postgres
cargo test                                    # 4 tests; each creates and drops its own database
```

The tests that need PostgreSQL **fail** with a clear message when the variable is not set; they never skip. Then run it against an empty database:

```sh
export FORGEBASE_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/crm
cargo run -- migrate                          # framework tables, schema sync, app migrations
echo 'a long password' | cargo run -- user create ann --role "Crm User"
FORGEBASE_DEV_INSECURE_COOKIES=1 cargo run -- serve    # http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1
```

Log in with `POST /api/v1/login` and `{"username": "ann", "password": "..."}`; the reply sets the session cookie. `GET /api/v1/meta/crm_note` then returns the DocType with `"app": "crm"`. `serve` does not migrate: run `migrate` after every change to DocTypes or migrations. `cargo run -- --help` lists the other commands. The binary of an app has all the commands of the stock `forgebase` binary, and does not need `--doctypes`.

## 3. DocTypes are embedded

`src/lib.rs` lists the files:

```rust
.doctypes(forgebase::doctypes!["doctypes/crm_note.toml"])
```

The files are read at **compile time**, with paths relative to the crate root, so the binary does not depend on the files at run time and a change to a file needs a rebuild. There is no directory scanning, so a file you forget to list would silently be missing; the test `every_doctype_file_is_listed` (it calls `forgebase::testing::assert_doctypes_listed`) fails instead. The file format is in [the architecture](../blueprint/architecture.md#doctype-file-format). Name every DocType with the app name as prefix: DocType names are global, and a name used by two apps is a startup error.

Change DocTypes additively. Adding a field or a DocType is applied by `migrate`; changing a field's type or length is refused (nothing is changed); reshaping existing data is a job for a migration.

## 4. Hooks

A hook set implements `forgebase::DocTypeHooks` for a DocType and is registered with `.hooks("crm_note", NoteRules)`. The sample trims the title and rejects a blank one. Hooks receive the document and a `HookContext`, run inside the operation's transaction, and have **no database access**. They run before the framework's own validation, so a value may be missing or of another kind: look before you change. The order of the hooks in each operation is in [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-lifecycle-pipeline-and-hooks.md) and in the documentation of `DocTypeHooks` (`cargo doc -p forgebase --open`). A hook is tested without a database by calling it with `HookContext::new(..)`, as the sample test does.

A DocType can also have an **approval workflow**: states and transitions with roles, written in the DocType file (`[workflow]`), and a `before_transition` hook for conditions. A transition needs a role of the transition and the right it stands for, and plain `submit` and `cancel` are refused on such a DocType. The short version is in the README ("Workflow") and the rules are in [ADR 0015](../adr/0015-workflow-states-and-transitions.md); the full guide section comes with M8.5.

## 5. Extend another app

Two complete, tested examples live in the Forgebase checkout: [`examples/sales`](../../examples/sales/README.md) (DocTypes, hooks, a data migration) and [`examples/sales_extension`](../../examples/sales_extension/README.md), which depends on `sales`, links to its `customer` and adds a hook to its `sales_order`. Read them next to this section; their tests are the model for yours.

Make a second app, `tasks`, that links to the notes of `crm` and adds a rule to them.

```sh
target/debug/forgebase new-app tasks --forgebase-path . --dir ~/apps   # in the Forgebase checkout
```

`tasks` starts with the same sample as `crm`, which it does not need. Remove its sample DocType, link `crm`, and then replace three files.

```sh
cd ~/apps/tasks
rm doctypes/tasks_note.toml
cargo add crm --path ../crm      # adds crm = { version = "0.1.0", path = "../crm" } to [dependencies]
```

`doctypes/tasks_task.toml` (new):

```toml
name = "tasks_task"
label = "Task"

[[fields]]
name = "subject"
type = "data"
required = true

[[fields]]
name = "note"
type = "link"          # a Link to a DocType of an app we depend on
target = "crm_note"

[[permissions]]
role = "Tasks User"
read = true
write = true
create = true
```

`src/lib.rs` (replaces the sample, including its `NoteRules` hook):

```rust
use forgebase::{App, DocTypeHooks, Document, HookContext, HookError, Value};

pub fn app() -> App {
    App::new("tasks")
        .version(env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))
        .depends_on(&["crm"])
        .doctypes(forgebase::doctypes!["doctypes/tasks_task.toml"])
        .hooks("crm_note", NoDrafts) // a hook on a DocType of crm
}

/// Rejects a note whose title starts with `DRAFT:`.
pub struct NoDrafts;

impl DocTypeHooks for NoDrafts {
    fn validate(&self, _ctx: &HookContext<'_>, doc: &mut Document) -> Result<(), HookError> {
        if let Some(Value::Text(title)) = doc.values.get("title")
            && title.starts_with("DRAFT:")
        {
            return Err(HookError::new("a draft note cannot be saved"));
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

`src/main.rs` lists the dependency first:

```rust
use std::process::ExitCode;

fn main() -> ExitCode {
    forgebase::Forgebase::new()
        .app(crm::app())
        .app(tasks::app())
        .run()
}
```

`tests/app.rs` (replaces the sample tests, which test the sample DocType and hook that are gone). It builds the same binary as `main.rs`, checks the hook without a database, and runs both apps end to end with a user that has both roles:

```rust
use forgebase::testing::{TestDb, assert_doctypes_listed, json};
use forgebase::{DocTypeHooks, Document, Forgebase, HookContext, Operation, Value};

use tasks::{NoDrafts, app};

/// The same apps, in the same order, as `main.rs`.
fn binary() -> Forgebase {
    Forgebase::new().app(crm::app()).app(tasks::app())
}

#[test]
fn every_doctype_file_is_listed() {
    assert_doctypes_listed(&app(), env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "doctypes");
}

#[test]
fn the_apps_fit_together() {
    binary().check().expect("valid apps");
}

#[test]
fn a_draft_note_is_rejected_by_the_hook() {
    let ctx = HookContext::new("crm_note", "ann", Operation::Insert);
    let mut doc = Document::default();
    doc.values
        .insert("title".to_owned(), Value::Text("DRAFT: idea".to_owned()));
    assert!(NoDrafts.validate(&ctx, &mut doc).is_err());

    doc.values
        .insert("title".to_owned(), Value::Text("Plan".to_owned()));
    NoDrafts.validate(&ctx, &mut doc).expect("not a draft");
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn tasks_link_to_notes_and_drafts_are_refused() {
    let binary = binary();
    let db = TestDb::new().await;
    db.migrate(&binary, false).await.expect("migrate");
    db.create_user("ann", &["Crm User", "Tasks User"]).await;
    let ann = db.client(&binary).login("ann").await;

    // The hook of `tasks` runs on the DocType of `crm`.
    let draft = ann
        .post("/api/v1/resource/crm_note", json!({"title": "DRAFT: idea"}))
        .await;
    assert_eq!(draft.status, 422, "{:?}", draft.body);

    let note = ann
        .post("/api/v1/resource/crm_note", json!({"title": "Plan"}))
        .await;
    assert_eq!(note.status, 201, "{:?}", note.body);
    let note_name = note.data()["name"].as_str().expect("name").to_owned();

    // A task links to the note of the other app.
    let task = ann
        .post(
            "/api/v1/resource/tasks_task",
            json!({"subject": "Call", "note": note_name}),
        )
        .await;
    assert_eq!(task.status, 201, "{:?}", task.body);
    db.cleanup().await;
}
```

Run `cargo test` in both crates (`crm` still passes on its own). The rules of the model:

- `depends_on` names apps that must be registered **earlier**. Nothing is sorted; a wrong order is an error.
- An app may link to, and register hooks for, DocTypes of **itself and its dependencies** only.
- An app **cannot change another app's DocType** (adding a field to `crm_note` from `tasks`, for example). Extend by hooks and by DocTypes of your own; custom fields on another app's DocType are planned for a later milestone.
- Hooks of one DocType run in app order, then in registration order: the hook of `tasks` runs after the hooks of `crm`, and can reject what `crm` accepted.
- Every DocType reports its owner in the metadata API (`"app"`).

## 6. Upgrade with migrations

`migrate` applies the schema changes of your DocTypes by itself. For changes to *data* (a backfill, a rename of a value) add a SQL migration: a file `migrations/0001_trim_subjects.sql`, listed in `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
.migrations(forgebase::migrations![
    (1, "trim_subjects", "migrations/0001_trim_subjects.sql"),
])
```

`forgebase migrate` runs them after the schema sync, in app order and version order, **once per database**, each in its own transaction together with the row in `fb_app_migration` that records it. A failing migration is rolled back and stops the run; the ones before it stay applied. The SQL must not contain `BEGIN` or `COMMIT`.

Migrations are **append-only**. The checksum of every applied migration is verified at every `migrate` (also with `--dry-run`), before anything but the framework migrations is changed:

- an applied migration that was **edited** is refused (`was changed after it was applied`);
- an applied migration that you **removed** from the list is refused;
- a **new** migration with a version lower than one already applied is refused (`a new migration must have a version above every applied one`), so number new migrations above the highest one. The numbers need not be consecutive.

`forgebase migrate --dry-run` shows what would be applied and changes nothing. Two `migrate` runs at the same time wait for each other (`--lock-timeout-ms`). `fb_app` records each app and the version it declared at its last migrate.

## 7. Background jobs and schedules

Work that should not happen inside a request, or that must happen later or on a timer, is a **job**. The full design is [ADR 0013](../adr/0013-jobs-scheduler-and-transactional-outbox.md); the running examples are `sales` and `sales_extension` (section 5), and every snippet below is from them.

**Register a job.** A job is a `JobHandler`, registered with `App::job`; it is known as `<app>.<name>`:

```rust
App::new("sales")
    .job("log_order_event", LogOrderEvent) // the job is `sales.log_order_event`
```

```rust
impl JobHandler for LogOrderEvent {
    fn run<'a>(&'a self, ctx: &'a mut JobContext<'_>) -> JobFuture<'a> {
        Box::pin(async move { /* use ctx */ Ok(()) })
    }
}
```

The handler returns a **boxed future** (`JobFuture`) because Forgebase has no async-trait dependency. Copy what you need out of `ctx.payload()` into owned values first: `ctx.documents()` borrows `ctx` mutably. The options (5 attempts, 30 s backoff doubling up to 1 h, 5 min timeout) are the defaults; `App::job_with` takes a `JobOptions`.

**Enqueue from a hook, with the outbox.** A hook calls `ctx.enqueue(name, payload)`. The job is written in the **same transaction** as the document change, after all hooks have run, so it exists only if the operation commits: a refused submit leaves no job.

```rust
fn before_cancel(&self, ctx: &HookContext<'_>, doc: &Document) -> Result<(), HookError> {
    let order = doc.name.as_deref().ok_or_else(|| HookError::new("no name"))?;
    ctx.enqueue("sales.log_order_event", json!({"order": order, "event": "cancelled"}))
}
```

`json!` is `forgebase::serde_json::json`. Never put a secret in a payload: it is stored in clear text. In a test, a hook needs a collector, or `enqueue` fails: `HookContext::new(..).with_jobs(&jobs)`, then `jobs.take()` lists what was enqueued (`EnqueuedJobs`).

**Be idempotent.** Delivery is **at least once**: a job can run twice (a worker crash, an operator's `job enqueue`). Everything the handler does to the database is atomic with the job's completion, but make the handler safe to repeat anyway, and any effect outside the database (an email) must be. Two ways from the examples: a row whose name is the idempotency key, looked up first (`get("sales_order_log", "<order>-<event>")`, which keeps the normal path quiet; for two runs at the same moment the unique name refuses the second insert, a failed insert runs in a savepoint so the transaction stays usable, and the handler looks again after it and returns `Ok` if the row now exists: a unique violation is a permanent `JobError`, so check for the row rather than for the error), and a field that remembers the source (`customer_visit.source_order`, looked up with a `list` filter). `ctx.id()` (the same for every attempt) and `ctx.attempt()` are there for effects that need a key or a log line.

**Read and write documents.** `ctx.documents()` offers `get`, `list`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `submit`, `cancel` and `amend`. It runs as the **system context** (no permission rules) with the actor `job:<app>.<job>`, which becomes the `owner` and `modified_by` of what the job writes. Validation and hooks run as usual, each write is a savepoint, and everything commits or rolls back with the job. `list` returns one page of at most 500 documents and has no offset.

**Errors.** A returned `JobError::new(..)` (and a database error) is retried with backoff, then the job is `dead` until `forgebase job retry`. `JobError::permanent(..)` skips the retries: use it for what retrying cannot fix, such as a payload that is wrong or an order that no longer exists. Errors of `ctx.documents()` already follow this rule, so `?` is usually enough.

**Run on a schedule.** `App::schedule(job, Schedule)` enqueues one of the app's own jobs on a timer: every N minutes, every day or every week, **UTC only** (no cron, no time zones):

```rust
.job("daily_summary", DailySummary)
.schedule("daily_summary", Schedule::daily_at(2, 0))
```

The job gets `{"scheduled_for": "<the tick, RFC 3339 UTC>"}`: the time that was due, not the time the worker noticed it, so use it as the idempotency key (`sales.daily_summary` summarizes the day before it and names the row by that day). A tick is enqueued once however many workers run. Ticks missed while no worker ran are **not caught up**: one job runs, then the next future time. `forgebase migrate` stores the schedules, so run it after you add, change or remove one (it deletes schedules the binary does not declare).

**Run it.** Jobs need a worker; schedules need a worker and `migrate`:

```sh
cargo run -p sales -- migrate
cargo run -p sales -- worker                  # until Ctrl-C or SIGTERM; --concurrency N
cargo run -p sales -- job list --status dead  # job show <id>, job retry <id>, job enqueue <name> --payload '{..}'
```

**Test it.** With the `testing` feature: `run_jobs(&binary, &db).await` runs every due job with the worker's own code and returns how many ended `done`, `retried` or `dead`; jobs that hooks and other jobs enqueue run too. `run_schedules_at(&binary, &db, time).await` enqueues the schedules that are due at `time` (read `next_run_at` from `fb_schedule` with `TestDb::rows`, and use `OffsetDateTime::from_unix_timestamp`), and `run_jobs` then runs them. To test delivery twice, copy a job row with `TestDb::exec` (`INSERT INTO fb_job ... SELECT ... FROM fb_job`) and run again. A job that is retried is queued again after its backoff, so `run_jobs` does not run it again in the same call. The tests of `sales` and `sales_extension` show each of these.

**Common errors.** A schedule for a job the app did not register is a startup error, reported with the other mistakes of the app before any command runs:

```
error: invalid app setup:
  - app `sales`: schedule for job `daily_sumary`, which `sales` did not register (register it with App::job first; an app schedules only its own jobs)
```

An unknown job name in `ctx.enqueue` is found at run time, not at startup (it is a string): it fails the **operation** that enqueued it when the job is written, with a message like ``unknown job `sales.log_order_evnt` (jobs are registered by the apps of the binary as `<app>.<job>`)``. A job of an app that the worker's binary does not contain stays `queued` until a binary that has it runs a worker.

**Query reports.** An app can also define a read-only SQL report (`App::report`, with `Report`, `Param` and `Column`) that is run by the roles it names; the SQL is compiled in, its parameters are `$1..$n` and always bound, and `forgebase migrate` checks it against the database. Row-level rules do not apply inside a report. The design, the limits and what to watch for are in [ADR 0016](../adr/0016-query-reports-read-only-execution.md); the full guide section is part of M8.5.

Running your app for real (several sites, a reverse proxy, workers, upgrades, backups and restores) is in the [operations guide](operations.md).

## The public API boundary

Apps depend on the `forgebase` crate **only**. `forgebase-core`, `forgebase-db` and `forgebase-http` are internal: they change without notice, and an app that uses them will break. `forgebase` re-exports everything an app needs (the list is in [ADR 0012](../adr/0012-app-model-and-public-api-boundary.md#the-public-surface-crate-root-of-forgebase)): `App`, `Forgebase`, `doctypes!`, `migrations!`, `DocTypeHooks`, `HookContext`, `HookError`, `Operation`, `Document`, `Value` and the helpers of `forgebase::testing` (enable the cargo feature `testing` in `[dev-dependencies]` only, as the template does, so it is not in your binary). The version is 0.x: the API may still change between minor versions, and every change is in the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md). If you need something that is not exported, ask for it; do not work around it.

## The Forgebase dependency

The generated `Cargo.toml` points at your checkout: `forgebase = { path = "<checkout>/crates/forgebase" }`. A relative `--forgebase-path` is written as an absolute path, because it is relative to where you ran the command, not to the new crate. To depend on a git revision instead, replace the two `forgebase` lines with `forgebase = { git = "https://github.com/agilma/Forgebase", rev = "<commit>" }` (the second one with `features = ["testing"]`); the repository is private, so that needs git access to it.

The app is its own Cargo workspace (`[workspace]` in its `Cargo.toml`), so a `Cargo.toml` in a parent directory does not take it over. `new-app` copies the checkout's `Cargo.lock` into the app, so your first build uses the dependency versions Forgebase is tested and license-checked with, not whatever is newest. Cargo drops the entries the app does not use and adds the app itself on first use, so the first command must not be `--locked`; after that it can be. Commit `Cargo.lock`. Updating dependencies later is your decision (`cargo update`).

The toolchain: `rust-version` in the generated `Cargo.toml` is the minimum Forgebase supports. The Forgebase checkout pins a toolchain in its `rust-toolchain.toml`, which does not apply to an app outside the checkout; use the same one (`rustup toolchain install <version>` and `cargo +<version> ...`, or your own `rust-toolchain.toml`).

## Common errors

Everything about how the apps fit together is checked **before any command runs**, and all problems are reported together (exit code 1). Real examples, from the apps of section 5:

```
error: invalid app setup:
  - app `tasks` depends on `crm`, which is registered after it; register `crm` first (apps are never sorted)
  - app `tasks`: doctypes/tasks_task.toml: field `note` of doctype `tasks_task` refers to `crm_note`, which belongs to app `crm`; app `tasks` does not depend on `crm` (add .depends_on(&["crm"]), registered before `tasks`)
  - app `tasks`: hooks registered for DocType `crm_note` of app `crm`, which `tasks` does not depend on
```

The first line is the cause; the other two follow from it. This is the output of `tasks` with `.app(tasks::app()).app(crm::app())` in `main.rs`. Without `.depends_on(&["crm"])` at all, only the last two lines appear (the second example below).

```
error: invalid app setup:
  - app `tasks`: doctypes/tasks_task.toml: field `note` of doctype `tasks_task` refers to `crm_note`, which belongs to app `crm`; app `tasks` does not depend on `crm` (add .depends_on(&["crm"]), registered before `tasks`)
  - app `tasks`: hooks registered for DocType `crm_note` of app `crm`, which `tasks` does not depend on
```

```
error: invalid app setup:
  - app `tasks`: hooks registered for unknown DocType `crm_notes`
```

```
error: cannot load DocType files:
  - app `tasks`: doctypes/tasks_task.toml: doctype `crm_note` is already defined by app `crm` (doctypes/crm_note.toml); a DocType belongs to one app
```

A DocType file that is not listed is caught by the test, not at startup:

```
app `tasks`: the embedded DocType list and .../tasks/doctypes differ; in the directory but not in doctypes![..]: ["doctypes/tasks_other.toml"]; in doctypes![..] but not in the directory: []
```

Migration errors (from `migrate`):

```
error: migration 1 (trim_subjects) of app `tasks` was changed after it was applied: expected checksum 1aded17b..., database has 80f843fe...
error: migration 2 (late) of app `tasks` is not applied, but migration 3 of the app is; a new migration must have a version above every applied one (renumber it above 3); nothing was applied
```

Other things you may meet:

- `FORGEBASE_TEST_DATABASE_URL is not set ... Tests never skip.`: set it to a superuser or `CREATEDB` URL (`postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/postgres`).
- `FORGEBASE_DATABASE_URL is not set`: the app's own database for `migrate`, `serve`, `user` and `doc`.
- `new-app`: `... is not a Forgebase checkout`: `--forgebase-path` must be the repository root (it contains `crates/forgebase`); `... already exists; new-app never overwrites`: choose another name or `--dir`.
- A hook cannot reach the database or the network on purpose ([ADR 0009](../adr/0009-lifecycle-pipeline-and-hooks.md)). Compute from the document, or reject the operation.
