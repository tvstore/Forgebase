# HTTP API

`serve` (here `cargo run -p sales -- serve`) runs the API on `FORGEBASE_LISTEN` (default `127.0.0.1:8000`). It serves the same DocTypes as `migrate` (the app's, or the `--doctypes` directory in the stock binary) but **does not run migrations**: run `migrate` first. Requests need a `Host` header from `FORGEBASE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma separated host names without ports, default `localhost,127.0.0.1`; an entry with a port is refused at startup). Ctrl-C or SIGTERM stops accepting connections and lets running requests finish for up to 10 seconds; a second signal, or the end of that period, exits at once (exit code 0; open database transactions are rolled back by PostgreSQL when the connection closes). The session cookie is `Secure`, so browsers send it over HTTPS only: put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front (the application has no TLS). For local development over plain HTTP, `FORGEBASE_DEV_INSECURE_COOKIES=1` omits `Secure` (and prints a warning); never use it in production. There is no CORS: serve the front-end from the same origin.

```sh
# Prepare: tables, a user with the Administrator role (the example DocTypes name other roles; Administrator may do everything)
cargo run -p sales -- migrate
printf '%s\n' 'a long password' | cargo run -p sales -- user create root --role Administrator

# Terminal 1: serve (development mode)
FORGEBASE_DEV_INSECURE_COOKIES=1 cargo run -p sales -- serve

# Terminal 2: log in. The response has the one-time CSRF token; the session cookie is saved in jar.txt.

Responses are JSON: `{"data": ...}` on success and `{"error": {"code", "message", "details"?}}` on failure, with stable codes (for example `unauthenticated` 401, `permission_denied` 403, `csrf_failed` 403, `not_found` 404, `conflict` 409, `validation_failed` 422, `invalid_query` 400). A document you cannot read is a 404, like a missing one. The route table, the request pipeline, the codes and the limits are in the [architecture](../blueprint/architecture.md#7-api-rest-resource-api-implemented-in-m33-metadata-and-session-routes-in-m41-the-rest-proposed) and the [security model](../blueprint/security-model.md#the-http-layer-implemented-in-m33). `/api/v1/method` (custom endpoints) is not implemented.
