# Forgebase documentation

The documentation of Forgebase, a Rust framework for building business applications. Start with the [README](../README.md) for what it is and a five-minute quick start; this page indexes everything else.

## Project status

**M0 Foundations, M1 Metadata and storage, M2 Relationships and lifecycle, M3 Auth, permissions and REST API and M4 Minimal Desk are done** (M4.1: the metadata API, the `desk/` React app with login, home and list view, served by `forgebase serve`; M4.2: the form view with Submit, Cancel, Amend and Delete, and one Playwright smoke test in CI) (M1.1: DocType metadata model and document validation in `forgebase-core`; M1.2: PostgreSQL pool, framework migrations and additive schema sync in `forgebase-db`; M1.3: document insert/get/update/delete in `forgebase-db` and the `forgebase` command-line tool). M2 was delivered in four PRs: M2.1 adds Link fields (foreign keys) and optimistic concurrency (`update` and `delete` need the expected version); M2.2 adds child tables (Table fields: rows saved with their parent in one transaction); M2.3 adds the lifecycle pipeline and hooks (`DocTypeHooks`, registered by the app; see ADR 0009); M2.4 adds docstatus (`submittable` DocTypes with `submit`, `cancel` and `amend`) and naming series (counters gapless per prefix). M3 was delivered in three PRs: M3.1 adds users, roles, Argon2id passwords, server-side sessions, API tokens and login lockout (`forgebase_db::auth`, ADR 0010) and the `forgebase user` and `forgebase token` commands; M3.2 adds role permissions (`[[permissions]]` in the DocType file, enforced in every document operation, deny by default; ADR 0011) and the list query (`forgebase_db::list`, `forgebase doc list`); M3.3 adds the HTTP API (`forgebase serve`: `/api/v1/resource`, login and logout, cookie sessions with CSRF protection, API tokens, `Host` validation, no CORS). M5 (app model and developer experience) is in progress: **M5.1** adds the app model (the entry crate is now called `forgebase`, a library and the `forgebase` binary; apps are plain Rust crates built from `forgebase::App` and listed in order in the binary's `main`; embedded DocTypes, hooks across apps, SQL data migrations per app, `forgebase::testing`; ADR 0012); **M5.2** adds `forgebase new-app` (generates an app crate that builds and passes its own tests, checked by the CI job `app-template`) and the [first-app guide](guide/first-app.md); example apps follow in M5.3. M6 (jobs and scheduler) is in progress: **M6.1** adds background jobs (a Postgres queue, `forgebase worker`, `forgebase job`, the transactional outbox for hooks; ADR 0013); **M6.2** adds the scheduler (`App::schedule`: every N minutes, daily or weekly, UTC) and the built-in clean-up jobs; the example apps follow in M6.3. **M7 (site management) is done:** M7.1 adds sites, a database per site, the `forgebase.toml` config file and `Host` routing (see [Sites](guide/cli.md#sites) and ADR 0014); M7.2 adds the apps installed per site, `forgebase site list` and `forgebase site create`; M7.3 adds `forgebase site backup` and `forgebase site restore`, the [operations guide](guide/operations.md) and the CI job `sites`, which completes M7. **M8 (workflow and reports) is done:** **M8.1** adds the workflow engine (`[workflow]` in the DocType file, transitions with a role and a right, the `before_transition` hook, a transition log; ADR 0015); **M8.2** adds the workflow to the desk (state badge, action buttons with a confirmation, an Activity history); M8.3 adds saved list views and the group-by summary (migration 0009, `/api/v1/views` and `/api/v1/summary`, and the Views, Columns and Summary buttons of the list); **M8.4** adds SQL query reports (ADR 0016: app-defined SQL, run by role in a read-only transaction with a timeout and a row limit, `GET` and `POST /api/v1/report`, and a Reports section in the desk); **M8.5** adds the approval workflow, the report "Sales by customer" and a shared saved view to the `sales` example, and the [guide on workflow, saved views and reports](guide/workflow-and-reports.md), which completes M8. **M9 (integration) is in progress:** M9.0 adds TLS to PostgreSQL (ADR 0018); **M9.1** adds app method endpoints (`App::method`, `POST /api/v1/method/{app}.{method}`, run as the caller in one transaction; ADR 0019) and a `DocError` for the documents handle, and closes a report's connection after it runs; webhooks, import and export and fixtures follow. The workspace has four crates, CI and a toolchain pin. The blueprint documents (see the table above) record research, proposed architecture and open decisions. ADRs 0002-0006 (workspace layout, PostgreSQL only, database access direction, HTTP stack, extension model) are Accepted; most other decisions are **Proposed**, not final. Each document marks its status.
